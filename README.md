<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Diego</h1>
<h3 align="center">DevOps & Platform Engineer | Go Enthusiast | Kubernetes Wizard | Automation Addict | Backend Builder | IoT Explorer</h3>

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Iâ€™m a DevOps and platform engineer with a knack for diving headfirst into new technologies. My happy place is where code meets infrastructure, and Iâ€™m on a never-ending mission to master Go (seriously, itâ€™s the love of my coding life).

On the backend side, Iâ€™ve wrangled Java (SpringBoot, Quarkus) and NodeJS (NestJS, ExpressJS), but letâ€™s face itâ€”Go always steals the show. ðŸš€

Iâ€™m big on automating all the thingsâ€”preferably in a clean, clever, and Kubernetes-powered way. GitOps? You bet, with tools like ArgoCD making life a lot more fun.

Microservices architecture? Been there, done that, streamlined it with Kafka, MQTT, and a sprinkle of IoT magic since 2021. Iâ€™ve got a soft spot for making complex systems justâ€¦ work.

When Iâ€™m not automating or coding, Iâ€™m probably dreaming up ways to automate something else. Welcome to my GitHub playgroundâ€”where smart solutions and bad puns collide. ðŸ¤–âœ¨
